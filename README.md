# TrustViz: A Multi-Agent AI and Blockchain-Based Fraud Detection System

## Problem Statement
E-commerce fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem that erodes trust between buyers and sellers. Sophisticated counterfeiters and fraudulent sellers use advanced techniques to deceive customers and platform owners. TrustViz aims to combat this by creating a resilient, intelligent, and transparent system for detecting and preventing fraud.

## Core Pillars
TrustViz is built on three core pillars that work in synergy:
1.  **Swarm Intelligence:** Decentralized AI agents monitor e-commerce platforms in real-time. They collaborate to identify suspicious patterns and coordinate complex analysis tasks, mimicking the collective intelligence of a swarm.
2.  **Perceptual AI:** When a visual inspection is required, the swarm can invoke a powerful Perceptual AI service. This service uses state-of-the-art Vision Transformers and Generative AI to analyze product images and detect subtle signs of counterfeiting.
3.  **Trust Ledger:** All findings and reputation events are recorded on a blockchain-inspired, immutable ledger. This creates a transparent and tamper-proof reputation system for sellers, empowering consumers to make informed decisions.

## High-Level Architecture
The system uses a modular, service-oriented architecture where components communicate asynchronously via a central message bus. This design ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

*   **Data Ingestion Service:** Collects data from e-commerce platforms.
*   **Swarm Intelligence Core:** A network of agents for real-time analysis and task coordination.
*   **Perceptual AI Service:** An on-demand service for advanced visual counterfeit detection.
*   **Trust Ledger Service:** Manages the immutable reputation ledger for sellers.
*   **API Gateway:** A single, secure entry point for all external interactions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
-   `api-gateway/`: Configuration for the API Gateway.
-   `docs/`: Project documentation and API specifications.
-   `services/`: Source code for each independent microservice (Data Ingestion, Swarm Intelligence, etc.).
-   `scripts/`: Utility and automation scripts.
-   `tests/`: Integration and end-to-end tests.
-   `.github/`: CI/CD workflow definitions.
